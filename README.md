# Quran for iOS

Quran application build for iOS.

## Beta Testing

It would be great if you could send an e-mail to ios@quran.com then we will enroll you to HockyApp as a tester and you can then download beta builds and help us find bugs before going live.

## Set up & More Info

App is under very early development.
We plan to release a very simple implementation with the least number of features that make the application usable by Ramadan 1437.
